# Contributing to Lumi

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to Lumi, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute:

-   reporting bugs
-   feature suggestions
-   fixing bugs
-   submitting pull requests for enhancements

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Lumieducation/Lumi/issues/), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.

Here is a [handy link for submitting a new bug](https://github.com/Lumieducation/Lumi/issues/new?labels%5B%5D=%5BType%5D%20Bug).

If you don't have a GitHub-Account we encourage you to create one or send an eMail to [c@Lumi.education](c@Lumi.education).

## Installing Lumi Locally

If you’d like to contribute code, first, you will need to run Lumi locally. Check out the Getting Started section in Lumi's [README](https://github.com/Lumieducation/Lumi#getting-started).

For more detailed instructions, see [Installing Lumi](../docs/en/install.md).

## Development Workflow

Running `npm start` will start the server and build all the code and continuously watch the front-end JS and CSS for changes and rebuild accordingly.
